CodeIgniter 3.1.13 was released today.

This includes a fix for a bug in the Session library that broke for PHP 5 due to a misnamed polyfill interface. It fixes a possible session fixation vulnerability where `session.use_strict_mode` wasnâ€™t enforced on PHP 7+, as well as several other important changes.

See the [change log](https://codeigniter.com/userguide3/changelog.html) for full details.

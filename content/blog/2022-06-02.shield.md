One of the most requested features in [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com) for years has been an authentication/authorization
solution. I'm proud to announce that today is that day. CodeIgniter now has an official auth library: [Shield](https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield).

Among the many features that Shield ships with are:

- Session-based authentication (traditional email/password with remember me)
- Stateless authentication using Personal Access Tokens
- Optional Email verification on account registration
- Optional Email-based Two Factor Authentication after login
- Magic Login Links when a user forgets their password
- Flexible groups-based access control (think roles, but more flexible)
- Users can be granted additional permissions
- User Entity and UserModel ready for you to use or extend
- A simple helper that provides access to the most common auth actions
- Easily extendable controllers
- All required views that can be used as is or swapped out for your own
- Highly configurable
- Built to extend and modify
- Save initial settings in your code so it can be in version control, but can also be updated in the database, thanks to our [Settings library](https://github.com/codeigniter4/settings)


While this is a beta release, it already provides a fairly thorough set of features, that should handle the needs of 80% of the projects your work on. We hope you find it helpful, and we're looking forward to see it continue to help you build secure applications in the future.
